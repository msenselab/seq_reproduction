This is a repository for a behavioral experiment on duration reproduction, coded in PsychoPy. 

Each trial begins with a Gabor patch presented for a specific duration. In some trials, a retro-cue in the form of a circle appears (Reproduction condition), instructing participants to reproduce the perceived duration by pressing a button. The button press initiates the display of a Gabor patch on the screen, which disappears when the button is released. In other trials, a retro-cue in the shape of a triangle appears (Following Condition), signaling that the Gabor patch will appear automatically. Participants must press the button when the patch appears and release it when the patch disappears.
